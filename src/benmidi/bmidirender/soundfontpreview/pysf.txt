The pysf utility is a way to create and edit SoundFont 2 files at the command line. It does this using XML configuration files and basic audio files (strict sub-set of .wav and .aif).

Each SoundFont2 file has one or more presets, each preset containing one or more preset zones, each preset zone mapping to an instrument, each instrument containing one or more instrument zones, each instrument zone mapping to a wavetable.

The pysf utility is released into the public domain.

(note: the latest pysf, from 
http://code.terrorpin.net/pysf/index
did not seem to work here as it does not seem to write presetId, only id and instrumentId
for preset in Presets:
    print(preset)
    is missing presetId key.
)
